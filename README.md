# Bulldozer game in C
This is the famous puzzle retro videogame, developed in the 90's about pushing rocks onto targets.

I developed a version in C using the SDL graphic library.

## Demo

[Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdxiQNExBM&t=1s "Youtube Video")

This is meant to be an educational project to learn about the use of the SDL graphic library.

>     Make sure you have already installed SDL 1.2 library on your PC to compile it!

## Overview

The game has ALL 60 levels.

First we have a level selector:

Now let's see a couple of examples about the levels

LEVEL 04 | LEVEL 29 | LEVEL 60
------------ | ------------- | -------------
<img src="Images/level04.png" width = "260"> | <img src="Images/level29.png" width = "260"> | <img src="Images/level60.png" width = "260">

And we have a final screen, from level 61... (end of the game)
